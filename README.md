## Description 
The present algorithm aims to select several typical and extreme environmental data samples (up to about 20-30) from near-shore Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements for further marine engineering analysis. Performance of the metod as well as the hyperparameter tuning are demonstrated on the example of ADCP datasets obtained by the Wood Island research site, Maine, USA. Two ADCPs were used to monitor environmental conditions around a kelp farm installation and were placed *42 m* away from each other. The devices measured water depth, significant wave height, significant wave period, and current velocity profiles averaged over *15 min* intervals from May 16 to May 28, 2019. More details on the research can be found in [Section 3.2 of this paper](https://github.com/alexanderknysh/thinplaterbf/blob/main/Methodology%20for%20multidimensional%20approximation%20of%20current%20velocity%20fields%20around%20offshore%20aquaculture%20installations.pdf).
